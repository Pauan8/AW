                <p>
                    I've been interested in computers since I can remember as we got it early in my life. The first
                    time I recognize the interest was when I was around 4 years old and my dad showed me a rendering in
                    AutoCAD. I was so fascinated!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In high school, I went towards IT for that very reason and studied graphic design. I've always liked
                    design, but it
                    is the combination of creative and logical thinking that just makes programming extra exciting and
                    I feel is just right for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did a Java course a long time ago and already liked it then, but chose to go towards a career in
                    science and biomedicine where my interest also lies. However, I think the career is very
                    stagnated in my current industry (healthcare) and I want to do something with more challenges and
                    possibilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have already started my path towards a career change as I am currently studying in a bootcamp for
                    frontend development at a company
                    called Technigo where we learn CSS / HTML / JS with React, node & Redux, but it
                    ends at the end of May. Because I'm interested in becoming full stack and would also think that AW
                    is a
                    fantastic way to enter the job market, I am now looking to you. Right now we have just started
                    JavaScript and I thrive like fish in water in the coding world!
                </p>
                <p>
                    AW would suit me perfectly as I am a big fan of the way you work - that you get knowledge about
                    methods that are actually used at the workplace and that there is a constant iteration thinking
                    which means that the education is constantly updated to what is relevant at that particular time
                    within
                    IT development. I also think a consulting role is a perfect start for me as
                    I am very hungry to get into the industry and test different methods and environments.

                    As a person I am very driven, helpful, motivated and thirsty for knowledge. I work well both in
                    teams
                    and individually and enjoy myslef most if it is a mixture of both.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hope to hear from you!
                    Sincerely, Pauline
                </p>
